# InstCryp 

## InstCryp is built during Money-Legos hacakthon April, 2020. It is Defi Crypto wallet supported by meta-transaction on top of Biconomy-Mexa SDK.

### What is InstCrypt?
  - InstCrypt provides Defi Gasless wallet which is supported by meta transaction.   
 - If you want to transfer crypto token to any ethereum address you need gas to perform a transaction. InstCrypt is providing gasless or meta-transaction wallet which is built on top of Biconomy-Mexa SDK. So, our simple aims to crypto should be use like fiat currency without requiring user to purchase gas for that(#GoGasLess).


### InstCrypt Come from Hackathon.

### What After Hackathon?
 - After Hackathon, We integrate Gasless Uniswap-V2 and Uniswap-V2 oracles to set up a trustless automated crypto trading platform without requiring the user to pass minimum return value for safety on top of Biconomy-mexa SDK to support Meta-transaction and Gasless.
- Other Features with Meta-Transaction or Gasless support
    - Integrate Kyber Swap.
    - Integrate Uniswap-V2 to enable automate trade.
    - Platform Saves transaction history of all wallet and trading transactions at and provide history one stop on platform.
